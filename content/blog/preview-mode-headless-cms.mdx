Now that CollectionBox is publically available the further development will be almost entirely guided by user feedback. I'm quite happy with the initial feature set that enables the core functionalities but allows for evolution over time.

This is a project that is being developed by one person (that's me) at this time. This means that every email, message and suggestion will be directly seen by the person working on the app every day. I'd really appreciate your honest feedback on the app. The changes that you suggest can be implemented and deployed in a few minutes to hours.

I picked the problem of fundraising because non profits always need more money and enabling them to do so more creatively and effectively seems like a good business idea. On the other hand there are probably a lot of other problems that face them and are harder to spot for somebody from the outside and can be solved with an app. I hope to learn from you about these problems and help you solve them.
